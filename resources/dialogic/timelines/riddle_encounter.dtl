narrator: (You stand before the chest, its surface carved with a riddle that has stumped many before you. The air in the room is thick with the dust of ages and the heavy burden of unmet expectations.)
little_king: I've tried everything I know, yet nothing works. How can I open this accursed chest?
narrator: (You pace back and forth, your mind racing through possibilities, each more frustratingly inadequate than the last. The chest remains as impassive as the stone walls surrounding you.)
little_king: Why can't I figure this out? There has to be a way to unlock it!
narrator: (The shadows seem to loom larger around you as time passes, each tick of the clock a reminder of your urgent need to prove your legitimacy to those who doubt your rule.)
little_king: I must find the answer... but how? This is far too hard.
