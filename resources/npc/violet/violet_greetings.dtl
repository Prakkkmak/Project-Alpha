violet: Welcome to my corner of the realm, young sovereign. My name is whispered in many circles, but few dare to seek me out. What wind brings you here?
- I'm exploring my kingdom, meeting those who make it whole.
	little_king: I am known as the Lady of Charms. Within the tapestry of court life, I am the unseen thread that quietly shapes destiny, weaving influence with just a word or a meaningful glance.
- They say you can sway the hearts of many. Is it really true?
	violet: Oh, it is true indeed. The heart is like a fortress â€” if you know the right paths, it can be gently conquered.
- Could I perhaps benefit from your... special services?
	Oh, my dear, you might be a bit young to fully appreciate the... finer aspects of my expertise. My arts are powerful, indeed, but they require a certain... maturity to wield effectively.
