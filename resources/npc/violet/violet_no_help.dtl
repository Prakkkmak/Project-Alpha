violet: Ah, seeking my counsel again?
little_king: Um, I have another request... Itâ€™s a bit unusual, but I need your help with a guard who is... well, difficult to persuade.
violet: And what, pray tell, might you offer in return for such assistance? My talents do not come cheaply, nor are they lent lightly
little_king: I hadn't considered... What would you ask of me in exchange for your help?
violet: I require something... Let's call it a token of appreciation. Something that catches my fancy, something as charming as the services I am to provide.
little_king: A token that could charm you... I understand. I will find something worthy and return to you.
