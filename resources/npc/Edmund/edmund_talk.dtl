edmund: Greetings again, Your Majesty. As I must uphold my duty, I remind you that the tower remains strictly off-limits today.
little_king: Still locked down, huh? I appreciate your diligence, but I'll need to find some way to persuade you otherwise.
edmund: I understand your concern, sire, but I am bound by orders. My apologies for any inconvenience.
little_king: No need for apologies; I respect the rules. Yet, a king must explore all options. We'll see what can be done.
