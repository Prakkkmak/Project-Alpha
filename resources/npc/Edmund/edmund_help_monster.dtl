little_king:  I need your help. A monster blocks the entrance to the library in the tower, and it’s crucial I get past.
edmund: Your Majesty, helping with such dangers is risky. My men and I would be putting ourselves at great risk.
little_king: I understand the danger, and I'm prepared to compensate you and your men for this risk. I will give you gold for your brave service.
edmund: Gold, you say? That does change things. If you are willing to pay for our service, we can arrange for an assault on the monster.
little_king: Yes, I assure you that you will be well-compensated.
edmund: Very well, Your Majesty. With the right incentive, my men and I will do our best to clear the path to the library. We’ll start planning immediately.
