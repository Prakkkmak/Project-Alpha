edmund: Welcome back, Your Majesty. The men were speaking of your last visit. They always appreciate seeing you.
little_king: That's kind of them. How are the guards today?
edmund: In high spirits, sire. The clear weather seems to have lifted everyone’s mood.
little_king: Yes, it’s been perfect lately. Ideal for your patrols, I’d imagine.
edmund: Indeed, it is. Better weather makes the night watches easier and the days pass pleasantly.
